            <p id="intro">I am Yahya, I am an engineering graduate, 
                with renewable energy focus. The year after graduation 
                has been hectic with even bigger and steeper learning curves
                 until Corona hit, the sudden drop in the learning curve forced 
                 me to look for an alternative during the global downtime, and 
                 found something to suit my past experiences well!</p>
